    script: 'Feeling tired? Let\'s reset! Take 10 quick breaths - in through nose, out through mouth, fast and energizing. Now stand and shake your whole body for 10 seconds - shake out the fatigue! Roll your shoulders back 5 times. Visualize caffeine-free energy flooding your system. You are recharged, refreshed, ready to tackle the rest of your day with renewed enthusiasm!'

    script: 'Stand in a power pose - feet wide, hands on hips or raised victoriously. Hold this for 30 seconds, breathing deeply. This posture tells your brain you are powerful and capable. Now visualize yourself succeeding at your next challenge. See it clearly - you are confident, articulate, capable. Feel this confidence as truth. You ARE strong. You ARE capable. You WILL succeed. Carry this certainty with you.'
