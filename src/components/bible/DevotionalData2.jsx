    title: "Journey to Purity: God's Design for Sexuality",
    introduction: "Sexuality is a gift from God. It is not shameful, not accidental, not a mistake God tolerates in His creation. God designed you as a sexual being, and He designed sexuality to be a beautiful expression of love, intimacy, and covenant within marriage. But our culture has distorted sexuality. It has separated sex from commitment, from relationship, from God's design. It has taught you to see your body as a commodity, to use people for pleasure, to consume sexual content without consequence. And for many, this has resulted in shame, brokenness, and distance from God. Purity is not about shame. It is about reclaiming God's design for your sexuality. It is about understanding that your body matters, that your choices matter, and that God's boundaries around sex are not restrictive—they are protective. This 14-day journey will help you understand God's design for sexuality, address the shame and brokenness that may have resulted from misuse, and chart a course toward sexual purity and healing. Whether you are a teenager navigating first relationships, a single adult struggling with sexual temptation, or someone healing from sexual sin, this journey invites you to see your sexuality through God's eyes: as beautiful, as worthy of protection, and as designed for something greater.",
    keyVerses: [
      {
        reference: "1 Corinthians 6:19-20",
        text: "Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.",
        insight: "Your body is not yours to do with as you please. It is the temple of the Holy Spirit. When you misuse your body sexually, you are desecrating God's temple. But when you honor God with your body, you are worshiping Him."
      },
      {
        reference: "Song of Solomon 2:7",
        text: "Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.",
        insight: "Sexual desire is real and powerful, but it is meant to awaken in its proper time and context—within marriage. Guarding your sexuality is not repression; it is honoring the power of what God has designed."
      },
      {
        reference: "Ephesians 5:3",
        text: "But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.",
        insight: "Purity means not just avoiding obvious sexual sin, but guarding your thought life, your media consumption, your boundaries with potential partners. It means protecting your heart and mind."

    reflection: "Shame is one of the most powerful weapons against purity. When you have already fallen into sexual sin, shame tells you that you are beyond redemption, that God cannot forgive you, that pursuing purity now is pointless. This is a lie. One of the most beautiful truths in Scripture is that Jesus welcomes the broken, the ashamed, the sexually broken. He met a woman caught in adultery and didn't condemn her—He offered her grace and called her to 'go and sin no more.' He can do the same for you. If you have already compromised your purity, this is not a journey of condemnation. It is a journey of restoration. God's grace covers all sin, including sexual sin. But grace is not the same as permission to continue. True grace transforms you. True grace calls you to something better. The path to purity is not easy. You live in a culture that floods you with sexual images and messages. Your body has powerful desires. Your heart may long for physical intimacy before marriage. But holiness is possible. Purity is possible. When you submit your sexuality to God's design, you experience freedom—freedom from shame, freedom from using people, freedom from addiction, freedom to experience sexuality the way God intended. It begins with a choice: to believe that God's design is good, to commit to guarding your purity, and to ask for God's help when you are weak.",
    reflectionQuestions: [
      "What messages about sexuality have you received from your family, culture, and church? Which ones align with God's design, and which ones don't?",
      "If you have fallen into sexual sin, what shame are you carrying? Can you bring that to God and accept His grace?",
      "What tempts you most sexually? Be honest about where you are vulnerable.",
      "What would it look like to honor God with your body in your current season of life?",

      title: "Pursuing Sexual Purity",
      steps: [
        "Get honest about where you are. Have you compromised your purity? Are you struggling with temptation? Do you feel shame? Name it. Bring it to God and to a trusted mentor or counselor.",
        "If you have fallen, confess and receive grace. 1 John 1:9 says 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' Confession is not punishment—it is the path to restoration.",
        "Guard your eyes and mind. What are you watching, reading, or engaging with that is feeding sexual temptation? Unsubscribe, unfollow, delete. Protect your thought life.",
        "Establish clear boundaries. Before temptation strikes, decide where your boundaries are. How far is too far? What situations do you need to avoid? Who do you need to talk to about your relationship?",
        "Find accountability. Tell someone you trust about your commitment to purity. Let them ask you hard questions. Be honest about your struggles.",
        "Practice gratitude for your body. Instead of seeing your body as a source of shame or as a tool for pleasure, see it as a gift. What can your body do? How can you take care of it?",
        "Redirect your desire. Sexual desire is not evil—it is powerful energy. When tempted, redirect that energy toward prayer, exercise, creative work, service to others. Replace the bad habit with something good."

    prayer: "Lord, I confess that I have misused my sexuality. I have allowed shame to tell me I am beyond redemption, or I have ignored Your design and pursued my own desires. Forgive me. Help me to understand that my body is Your temple, worthy of honor and protection. Heal me from shame. Give me strength to resist temptation. Guard my eyes, my mind, and my heart. Help me to see sexuality the way You see it—as beautiful, as powerful, and as meant for commitment and covenant. And if I am single, help me to wait well, to trust Your design, and to honor You with my body. In Jesus' name, Amen."
